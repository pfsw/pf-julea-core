# JUnit Log Event Assertion (JULEA) Core

This library is the common core implementation for a simple way of tracking log events during the execution of JUnit tests
and asserting the existence or non-existence of specific log events during the test execution.

For using these capabilities one of the following libraries must be included into the dependencies of a project.
They are doing the integration of the generic core functionality with specific logging frameworks.

- pf-julea-log4j2 (integration with Apache log4j logging framework)
